A Korean-born, Canadian-raised software engineer with a passion for optimizing workflows.

Expected graduate of the University of Toronto's Computer Engineering program in 2024, interested in the web, automotive, financial, and more!

As an occasional chef, part-time adventurer, and football fanatic, I'm always looking for new experiences and challenges.
