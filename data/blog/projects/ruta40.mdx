# RUTA40

RUTA40 was an electric camping van project for EMG Global, 
just starting out as I joined. The project became an ongoing effort within the company
throughout the 1 year I was at EMG Global which had a blast of a take-off to become a
major hit in the Korean camping car market.

Some highlight work I did for this project was to create interative versions of its website,
and a React web app & Android app for users of the RUTA40 camping vans where I had great fun
bringing everything I knew together to create it.

## Tech Stack

The initial web app was built with:
- `React.js` for frontend
- `Spring Boot` for backend
- `PostgreSQL` for database

Where this presentation layer was connected to an Android WebView application for easier 
access to the users (later connected to an iOS app as well later down the road).

Also of interesting note was all the pipelines that were needed for vehicle-to-server communication!
As complex as they were, the data (CAN protocol battery data, module-to-server communication, etc.) was 
processed by other senior team members to be delivered to the frontend in a abstracted fashion. 
The refresh and display of all those data was also fun to work with. 

## Background

EMG Global is a startup company that was founded from a research lab of a parent company.

In the global movement to reduce carbon emission, Korea was also taking part by providing subsidies
to electric vehicles. In a complicated history with another company, EMG Global's parent company
had purchased some 80 electric vans at a discount.

Different ideas were being thrown around to figure out what to do with these vans, and a camping van 
idea sparked the floor. As a test run, we put in engineers to start converting one van to see 
if it was going to be feasible. By the end of the month, 20 vans were being primed for their new
life as camping vans.

## The Technical Problems

Aside from the mechanical, electrical, and other engineering problems, my team faced problems from how
non-modern the vehicle was. The pre-installed infotainment system and interface was very outdated,
and it was difficult to harness the data from the vehicle (had to learn by trial and error).
