# Molipdo

A fun project I worked on during my time at Hoek Agency, where I was given the lead developer
role to gather requirements, architect the design, and deliver the implemented solution.

## Tech Stack

- `React.js`, with `Next.js` and `TypeScript`
- `Node.js`, with `Koa.js`
- `MySQL` database from AWS
- `Docker` for containerization

Something of interest was a study I performed for the web app to be released as a PWA (Progressive Web App),
to make way for more features aligning to the a wider set of requirements in the future.

## Background

Hoek Agency can be seen as just a brand agency from the outside. But if you are a member of
the company, you get to know that there is much more to it than just branding.

There was always the discussion of "what is work?" and "how do you work better?" in the company.
As a result of the discussions, we decided to make the "Hoek" way of working something to be 
shared with as a product! 

And thus, the exodus away from 'non-Hoek' tools began in year 2023.
